# Cinematic Design System

Generate a cinematic design system bundle — **four Markdown docs plus two HTML previews** — by running a film-driven workflow. The shared design system is **back-derived** from per-page compositions, never front-loaded.

## Argument Parsing

Parse any text that follows `$cinematic-design-system`. No arguments required. If the user's message already contains a director, film, genre, or niche, record them and skip those questionnaire items.

## Inputs

No file inputs. The skill takes its inputs from a start questionnaire (see *Phase 0*).

Optional: visual references (screenshot, URL, mood board). If supplied, they are decomposed — never copied — per `references/reference-protocol.md`.

## Outputs

| File | Phase | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/RESEARCH.md` | 1 | Director/film research, demo uniqueness audit, reference decomposition |
| `docs/UX_DESIGN.md` | 2 | Scene theses, signature compositions, motion orchestration |
| `docs/INFO_ARCHITECTURE.md` | 2 | Site map, page roles, nav hierarchy, beat sequences |
| `docs/DESIGN.md` | 3 | Back-derived design system in FILM_TEMPLATE 9-section format |
| `docs/preview.html` | 4 | Light-mode token preview |
| `docs/preview-dark.html` | 4 | Dark-mode token preview |

## The Iron Law

**DO NOT write `docs/DESIGN.md` until `docs/UX_DESIGN.md` is LOCKED.**

The shared design system is derived last, back from locked page compositions. Writing DESIGN.md first flattens pages into a template. That is the failure mode this skill exists to prevent.

## The 4 Phases

| # | Phase | Output | Read references |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Start Questionnaire | — | (this file) |
| 1 | Decisions | `docs/RESEARCH.md` | `phase-1-decisions.md`, `demo-uniqueness.md`, `anti-convergence.md`, `reference-protocol.md`, `data/directors-200.md` |
| 2 | Storyboard | `docs/UX_DESIGN.md` + `docs/INFO_ARCHITECTURE.md` | `phase-2-storyboard.md`, `premium-calibration.md`, `anti-convergence.md`, Phase 2 data files |
| 3 | Back-derive design | `docs/DESIGN.md` | `phase-3-compile.md`, `anti-garbage.md`, `implementation-guardrails.md`, Phase 3 data files |
| 4 | Render previews | `docs/preview.html` + `docs/preview-dark.html` | `phase-4-preview.md`, `assets/FILM_TEMPLATE/preview*.html`, `docs/DESIGN.md` |

Read `references/phase-1-decisions.md`, `references/phase-2-storyboard.md`, `references/phase-3-compile.md`, and `references/phase-4-preview.md` for full procedural details — including loading order, gates, and completion criteria.

### Phase 0: Start Questionnaire

Run on every invocation before Phase 1. Mirror the user's language. One blocking question at a time.

The skill has **two distinct operating modes**:

- **Extraction mode** (`Screenshot`) — the user provides a URL or image; the reference IS the subject. Derive all five identity fields from it.
- **Build modes** (`Step-by-step`, `Surprise me`) — the user is designing a new project; ask for niche + pages.

**Auto-detect extraction mode**: if the first argument after `$cinematic-design-system` is a URL or image path, treat as Screenshot mode. Do not ask the user to pick an entry mode first.

**Extraction mode questionnaire**:

1. Fetch the URL (inspect `<title>`, H1, nav, meta tags, visible palette, typography; crawl a few nav links to discover the page list). For an image, inspect via multimodal reading.
2. Derive `(film, director, genre, niche, page list)` from the reference. Infer the film from URL path hints first (e.g. `/demo/cloud-atlas` → *Cloud Atlas*), then visible content, then aesthetic signature.
3. Present all five fields in a single confirmation: *"I'll extract the design system describing this reference as: {film} ({director}) — {niche} — pages: {page list}. Proceed?"*
4. Accept corrections in one reply. Only ask for a specific field if inference fails on it.
5. Ask one other blocker: image placeholders y/n.
6. **Do NOT ask** a niche-and-pages menu. The reference IS the site.

**Build mode questionnaire**:

1. **Entry mode**: `Step-by-step` or `Surprise me`
2. **Image placeholders**: yes / no
3. **Site context**: niche + page list (required in build modes)

### Entry Specification Rules (build modes only)

In extraction mode these rules do not apply — the identity fields are derived from the reference.

| User supplies | Skill does |
|---|---|
| *film only* | Derive director + genre from the film |
| *director only* | Pick a film from filmography; record implicit genre |
| *genre only* | Pick director → pick film |
| *director + genre* | Pick film in that genre, from director's filmography if possible |
| *director + film* | Use both — allowed even if mismatched (director = lens, film = reference) |
| *genre + film* | **DISALLOWED** — film implies genre. Block at selection. If both arrive, keep film, discard genre |
| *nothing* (Surprise me) | Pick genre → director → film, honoring the shell-ban list |

### Phase 1: Decisions

1. **Lock identity fields**. In extraction mode, carry forward the five fields confirmed in Phase 0. In build modes, apply the Entry Specification Rules from Phase 0.
2. Run anti-convergence 3-question film test (`anti-convergence.md`). **Gate** in build modes; **descriptive** in extraction mode (film is given by the reference).
3. Web-research the committed director and film when possible. In extraction mode, also study the reference site itself in depth. Mark weaker pass when web access unavailable.
4. Run Demo Uniqueness Protocol (`demo-uniqueness.md`). **Preventive** in build modes; **diagnostic** in extraction mode (flag redundant extractions, don't fail them).
5. Decompose user-supplied references per `reference-protocol.md`. **Build mode only** — in extraction mode the reference IS the subject.
6. Copy `assets/FILM_TEMPLATE/RESEARCH.md` → `docs/RESEARCH.md`, fill in every section.

### Phase 2: Storyboard

**Mode framing**: in extraction mode, Phase 2 is *observational* — describe what the reference already does. In build modes, Phase 2 is *generative* — design the scenes and compositions for the new project. Same fields, same gates.

**Order** (non-negotiable): site-wide cinematic grammar → per-page scene theses → per-page signature compositions → hold back shared system for Phase 3.

1. Write Site Cinematic Grammar (shell, navigation, framing, density, materials)
2. Write Director Brief (thesis, 3 techniques with dominant/echo assignment, motion rules, typography direction)
3. Run Premium Calibration (12 required outputs)
4. For each major page: scene thesis, one big idea, hero dominance, restraint, material thesis, page-role scene, signature composition, grid fallback test, narrative arc, entrance map, motion budget, library citations, scene breakdown
5. Write `docs/INFO_ARCHITECTURE.md` in parallel (site map, page roles, nav, beat sequences, anti-convergence report)
6. Run anti-convergence cross-check: same archetype id ≤2× across site, interior pages ≠ homepage shell, ≥2 structurally distinct sections per page
7. Copy `assets/FILM_TEMPLATE/UX_DESIGN.md` and `assets/FILM_TEMPLATE/INFO_ARCHITECTURE.md` → `docs/`
8. Get user approval when collaborative

**Interaction budget** (enforced in Phase 2, carried into Phase 3): ≤1 heavy interaction per page, ≤2 attention-seeking reveals, `fadeUp`/`opacity+translateY` ≤2× per page, ≥4 distinct entrance types per page, no adjacent repeats.

### Phase 3: Back-derive the Design System

1. Copy `assets/FILM_TEMPLATE/DESIGN.md` → `docs/DESIGN.md`
2. Back-derive each of the 9 FILM_TEMPLATE sections from locked UX_DESIGN.md using mapping rules in `phase-3-compile.md`
3. Preserve **"brand color"** as a CTA term of art in §2 — industry convention, do not rename
4. Cite library source ids for every heavy interaction, signature composition, atmosphere layer; mark custom moves as `Custom` with justification
5. Do not leak process language (`chapter`, `director`, `film`, `calibrated`, `treatment`, `report build`) into user-facing sections
6. Run final anti-garbage filter

### Phase 4: Render Previews

1. Copy `assets/FILM_TEMPLATE/preview.html` → `docs/preview.html`
2. Copy `assets/FILM_TEMPLATE/preview-dark.html` → `docs/preview-dark.html`
3. Replace `@` placeholders with concrete values from DESIGN.md tokens: `@FILM-NAME`, `@FILM-REFERENCE-URL`, `@FONT-IMPORT`, `@ROOT-VARS`, `@COLOR-SECTIONS`, `@TYPE-SAMPLES`, `@BUTTON-VARIANTS`, `@CARD-EXAMPLES`, `@ELEVATION-CARDS`
4. Dark variant: byte-identical body, only `:root` vars + `.nav` background + `.footer`/`.section-divider` borders change. Color swatch values stay literal (`#ffffff` stays `#ffffff`).
5. Do not rename class names (`.color-swatch`, `.type-sample`, `.button-row`, `.card-grid`, `.form-group`, `.spacing-block`, `.radius-box`, `.elevation-card`, `.nav-brand`)

## Behavior Rules

- Preserve director + film as the primary source of feeling. Use palette, typography, material, composition, and motion.
- Keep film metadata (director, film title, chapter markers) inside `RESEARCH.md` and `UX_DESIGN.md`. **Do not expose them in DESIGN.md or the preview body copy.**
- Interior pages must feel like new scenes in the same film, not simplified copies of the homepage.
- Every major page needs one signature composition that breaks if replaced by a default grid.
- Treat grid as infrastructure, not composition. A visible 2×2 or 3-column card matrix as the main composition is a failure.
- Remove 20% of obvious moves rather than add 20% more detail.
- Do not read the entire references library at once. Progressive loading per phase (see the Phases table above).
- Do not jump to DESIGN.md without writing RESEARCH.md and UX_DESIGN.md first.
- When web research is unavailable, state the constraint explicitly and continue with best-effort inference.

## Relationship to Other Skills

- `ux-design` also writes `docs/UX_DESIGN.md` from a PRD. Use that for non-cinematic projects. Both skills should not be run on top of each other without a reset.
- `ux-redesign` can audit the `docs/UX_DESIGN.md` written by this skill.
- `design-system-extractor` writes `docs/DESIGN.md` from screenshots. Use that when the user has a visual reference to tokenize.
- `design-system-web-applier` / `-mobile-applier` consume `docs/DESIGN.md` and produce framework-specific theme files.

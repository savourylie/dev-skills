# dev-skills

Software development workflow skills for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code).

## Skills

### `/implement-ticket`
Implements tickets from a project's ticket tracker (`docs/tickets/`), one by one. Reads the PRD and design doc, picks the next pending ticket, implements it, runs code review, commits, updates ticket status, and loops until all tickets are done.

### `/review-ticket`
Reviews code changes for bugs using a structured priority system (P0-P3). Supports uncommitted changes, branch diffs, PR diffs, and ticket-based review. Applies strict bug detection criteria to minimize false positives.

### `/update-ticket`
Updates a ticket's status, cascades dependency changes to dependent tickets, refreshes `INDEX.md` counts and dependency graph, and commits.

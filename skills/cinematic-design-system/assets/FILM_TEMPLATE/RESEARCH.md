# Research — [Film]

<!--
TEMPLATE — FILM_TEMPLATE/RESEARCH.md, written by the cinematic-design-system
skill in Phase 1. Captures the director + film research, the Demo Uniqueness
Protocol audit, and any user-provided reference decomposition.

This file is the emotional and research substrate for the rest of the bundle
(UX_DESIGN.md, INFO_ARCHITECTURE.md, DESIGN.md). The film is research input,
not a spec sheet — do not paste plot summaries. Capture structural visual
signals only: palette, lighting behavior, framing logic, scene rhythm,
production design, director signature techniques.

Do not expose director name, film title, chapter markers, or calibration
jargon inside DESIGN.md or preview.html. They live here.

## Entry Mode

<!-- How the user entered the workflow. One of:
     - Screenshot (extraction mode: reference IS the subject)
     - Step-by-step (build mode: designing a new project)
     - Surprise me (build mode: skill picks the film for a new project)
     Note any user-supplied constraints or the reference URL/image path. -->

- **Mode**: [Screenshot (extraction) / Step-by-step (build) / Surprise me (build)]
- **Reference** (Screenshot mode only): [URL or image path]
- **User-supplied** (build modes only): [film only | director only | genre only | director+film | director+genre | nothing]
- **Notes**: [any free-text constraints the user gave, or derivation notes from the reference]

## Director

- **Name**: [Director Name]
- **Signature techniques** (3, specific, cinematographic — not "feels premium"):
  1. [e.g. "Extreme horizontal negative space with slow lateral reveals"]
  2. [e.g. "Color grading dominated by industrial teal + warm sodium"]
  3. [e.g. "Long-take camera with minimal cuts; time is the composition"]
- **Source of derivation**: [how the director was chosen — user pick / derived from film / picked from `directors-200.md` / picked by Surprise me]

## Film

- **Title**: [Film Title]
- **Year**: [YYYY]
- **Genre**: [Genre — derived from the film if not supplied]
- **Why this film for this niche** (anti-convergence 3-question test):

  <!-- Build modes: this is a gate. If any answer is unsatisfactory, pick a
       different film before continuing.
       Extraction mode: the film is given by the reference. These questions
       become descriptive analysis of how well the existing film fits the
       existing niche. Record the answers; do not re-pick the film. -->

  1. *What specific visual problem does this film solve for the niche?* [Concrete cinematographic quality — not "feels premium"]
  2. *Would this same film work equally well for three unrelated niches?* [If yes in build mode, pick differently; if yes in extraction mode, note that the reference's choice is generic]
  3. *Are you picking the film or its reputation?* [Rebuild justification from specific scenes / shots / decisions]

## Niche and Pages

- **Niche**: [e.g. "architecture firm", "independent record label", "climate research org"]
- **Pages**: [page list — e.g. "Home / Work / Studio / Contact"]
- **Image placeholders**: [yes / no]

## Film Research Notes

<!-- Required when web access is available. Mark the source type (primary /
     secondary) and keep notes focused on structural signals. No plot summaries.
     No trivia. If web access was unavailable, say so and mark the pass as
     weaker. -->

- **Web access**: [available / unavailable]
- **Research sources**: [URLs or source names, one per line]

### Film palette

- **Primary hues**: [e.g. "sodium yellow #d4a85b, industrial teal #2a4d55, concrete grey #6b6b6b"]
- **Lighting behavior**: [e.g. "high-contrast directional key, soft ambient fill, long shadows"]
- **Accent strategy**: [e.g. "single warm accent against cool base — appears in <5% of scenes"]

### Cinematography & framing

- **Framing logic**: [e.g. "1.85:1, horizon near top third, negative space dominates left"]
- **Camera behavior**: [e.g. "slow lateral dolly, minimal zooms, long takes averaging 12s"]
- **Scene rhythm**: [e.g. "long establishing → brief action beat → long return to quiet"]

### Production design & material

- **Surfaces**: [e.g. "wet concrete, anodized metal, linen fabric, carbon"]
- **Atmospheric layers**: [e.g. "haze, scan lines, dust particulate, window fog"]
- **Color grading behavior**: [e.g. "teal-orange with desaturated midtones, preserved blacks"]

### Director signature techniques (expanded)

<!-- Elaborate the 3 signature techniques from the Director section above. For
     each, name the concrete cinematographic move and a first-pass web translation. -->

1. **[Technique]** — [cinematographic description] → [web translation note]
2. **[Technique]** — [description] → [web translation note]
3. **[Technique]** — [description] → [web translation note]

## Niche References (2-3 premium sites in the same niche)

<!-- When web access is available, find 2-3 premium sites that already serve
     this niche well. Decompose each — not copy. Extract borrowable dimensions
     only: rhythm, density, typography attitude, framing, navigation posture. -->

- **[Site 1]** ([URL])
  - Rhythm: [observation]
  - Density: [observation]
  - Navigation posture: [observation]
  - Typography attitude: [observation]
- **[Site 2]** ([URL])
  - Rhythm: [observation]
  - ...
- **[Site 3]** ([URL])
  - ...

## Reference Decomposition

<!-- Only if the user provided visual references (screenshot, URL, mood board).
     Classify by risk per reference-protocol.md, extract borrowable dimensions
     only, forbid full composition copying. Delete this whole section if no
     references were provided. -->

- **Reference**: [URL or filename]
- **Classification**: [high risk — social platform | medium — brand/campaign | low — editorial/film institution]
- **Borrowed dimensions**:
  - Rhythm: [what to borrow]
  - Density: [what to borrow]
  - Navigation posture: [what to borrow]
- **Explicitly rejected**: [surface aesthetic / grid skeleton / full section order / anything that would cause reference drift]
- **Rewriting plan**: [how the borrowed dimensions get refiltered through the chosen director/film]

## Demo Uniqueness Audit

<!-- Always present. If the user has prior outputs from this skill (or prior
     cinematic sites in this workspace), audit them. If not, still write a
     shell-ban list targeting the most common fallback templates. -->

### Previous-work audit

- **Prior outputs reviewed**: [list paths / project names, or "none available"]
- **Recurring traits most likely to repeat** (name specific shell traits, not colors):
  - [e.g. "left-copy right-object hero"]
  - [e.g. "stacked framed panels with pill metadata row"]
  - [e.g. "dark luxury palette with thin borders"]

### Shell-ban list

<!-- Layout traits explicitly forbidden in the new project. Wireframe-level,
     not surface-level. A new demo fails if its wireframe would still look
     like a previous demo after removing color, type, and decorative effects. -->

- [e.g. "No left-copy right-object hero"]
- [e.g. "No 3-column card matrix as main page composition"]
- [e.g. "No dark luxury palette with thin borders"]

### Primary composition family

<!-- The new project's committed structural direction. Must differ from the
     user's most recent comparable output. -->

- **Chosen family**: [e.g. "corridor", "full-bleed stage", "vertical tower", "archive wall", "panoramic slab", "cutaway monolith"]
- **Why it fits the film**: [one sentence]
- **Why it differs from last output**: [one sentence]

## Research Pass Quality

- **Overall pass**: [strong / adequate / weak]
- **Web research available**: [yes / no]
- **Open gaps**: [anything you wanted to find but couldn't]
- **Next phase blocked on**: [nothing / user confirmation / specific research hole]

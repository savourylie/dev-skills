**Argument:** `$ARGUMENTS`

Close the loop on `/create-worktree`. Merge each ticket's branch back into its base, then remove the worktree directory and delete the local branch. If a branch was already merged remotely (typical after a GitHub PR merge), detect that and skip straight to cleanup so we don't create a redundant merge commit.

## Phase 1: Parse Arguments

Use the same rule as `/create-worktree` so users don't have to learn two grammars. Split `$ARGUMENTS` on whitespace and classify each token:

- **Ticket number** — matches `^\d+$`, `^#\d+$`, or `^TICKET-\d+$` (case-insensitive). Normalize to a 3-digit zero-padded number.
- **Base branch** — anything else. At most one base-branch token. Two or more non-ticket tokens → report the conflict and stop.

If no ticket numbers are provided, ask the user for at least one and stop. If no base-branch token is provided, default the base to `main`.

Examples:

| Invocation | Tickets | Base |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/merge-worktree 7` | 007 | main |
| `/merge-worktree 7 8 9` | 007, 008, 009 | main |
| `/merge-worktree 7 dev` | 007 | dev |
| `/merge-worktree TICKET-007 release-2026` | 007 | release-2026 |

## Phase 2: Resolve the Main Repo Root and Tickets

1. Confirm we're inside a git repo. Resolve the **main** repo root so the skill behaves the same whether invoked from the main checkout or from another worktree:
   ```
   MAIN_ROOT=$(dirname "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)")
   ```

2. For each ticket number `NNN`, glob `$MAIN_ROOT/docs/tickets/NNN-*.md`.
   - If no file matches, report `TICKET-NNN not found in docs/tickets/` and stop the whole batch — a typo in one number means the user wants to fix the input rather than half-cleanup.
   - If multiple files match, report the ambiguity and stop.

3. Extract the slug from each filename (strip the `NNN-` prefix and `.md` suffix). For each ticket, record:
   - Worktree path: `$MAIN_ROOT/.worktrees/NNN-<slug>`
   - Branch name: `ticket-NNN-<slug>`

## Phase 3: Pre-flight Checks

These run once before touching any ticket. If any of them fail, stop the entire batch — a clean refusal is much better than a half-applied state.

1. **CWD must not be inside a target worktree.** If the user's current working directory is inside any worktree we're about to remove, removing it would orphan their shell. Compare `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` against each target worktree path. If there's a match, refuse and tell the user to `cd "$MAIN_ROOT"` first.

2. **Main checkout must be clean.** The merge will land on the main checkout's HEAD, so any uncommitted changes there would be at risk. Run `git -C "$MAIN_ROOT" status --porcelain`. If it produces any output, refuse and tell the user to commit, stash, or discard.

3. **Fetch the base.** Run `git -C "$MAIN_ROOT" fetch origin <base>`. If `origin` is missing or the fetch fails (no remote, no network, no such ref), continue with the local base branch and warn the user that the result may be merging against a stale base.

4. **Resolve the base ref.** Prefer `origin/<base>`; fall back to local `<base>`. If neither exists, report `base branch '<base>' not found locally or on origin` and stop.

5. **Switch the main checkout to the base branch and fast-forward it.**
   - If local `<base>` exists: `git -C "$MAIN_ROOT" switch <base>`.
   - If local `<base>` doesn't exist (only `origin/<base>` was found): `git -C "$MAIN_ROOT" switch -c <base> origin/<base>`.
   - Then update local base to match origin: `git -C "$MAIN_ROOT" merge --ff-only origin/<base>` (skip if no `origin/<base>`). If the FF fails (local base has diverged from origin), abort and report — that's a real situation that needs human judgment, not a default decision.

6. **Worktree dirty-state scan + auto-commit.** The natural cktk workflow is `/implement-ticket NNN worktree` → `/update-ticket NNN` → `/merge-worktree NNN`, which leaves implementation code uncommitted in the worktree (only ticket metadata gets committed by `/update-ticket`). Rather than refuse to merge, we detect this state up front and offer to commit it.

   For each target ticket whose worktree exists on disk, run `git -C "<worktree_path>" status --porcelain`. If the output is non-empty, record the ticket plus a short summary of what's dirty — counts of modified / added / deleted / untracked files derived from the porcelain status codes (`M`/`A`/`D`/`??`) — into a "dirty worktrees" list.

   If the dirty list is empty, proceed to Phase 4. Otherwise, present the list to the user in a single batched message and wait for confirmation:

   ```
   Found uncommitted changes in 2 worktree(s):

     TICKET-007  3 modified, 1 untracked   (.worktrees/007-fix-search)
     TICKET-009  1 modified                (.worktrees/009-add-export)

   Auto-commit each before merging? [Y/n]
   ```

   - **If yes** (default): for each dirty worktree, in order:
     1. Read the ticket title from `docs/tickets/NNN-*.md` (first H1 line) for commit-message context.
     2. Inspect the changes: `git -C "<worktree_path>" diff HEAD` (and `git -C "<worktree_path>" status --porcelain` for untracked files).
     3. Generate a single conventional-style commit message that reflects the changes — subject line ≤72 chars, referencing the ticket as `TICKET-NNN`. Don't pad with boilerplate; let the diff drive the message.
     4. Stage and commit: `git -C "<worktree_path>" add -A` then `git -C "<worktree_path>" commit -m "<message>"`.
     5. **If the commit fails** (e.g., a pre-commit hook blocks it), do **not** retry with `--no-verify`. Mark this ticket with an error and continue with the next dirty worktree — Phase 4 step 2 will then skip the merge for it because the worktree is still dirty.
     6. Tag tickets that were committed here so Phase 5 can label them `auto-committed` in the report.
   - **If no**: leave those worktrees alone. They'll be skipped naturally by Phase 4 step 2's defensive dirty check.

## Phase 4: Per-Ticket Merge and Cleanup

Process tickets in the order given. Each ticket is independent — one ticket's failure should not stop the others.

For each `(NNN, slug, worktree_path, branch)`:

1. **Already cleaned up?** If neither `<worktree_path>` exists on disk (and is registered in `git worktree list --porcelain`) nor the branch exists (`git rev-parse --verify --quiet <branch>` fails), record as "already cleaned up" and continue.

2. **Worktree clean?** Defensive guard — by Phase 3 step 6 the worktree should already be clean (either it always was, or the user accepted the auto-commit prompt). If the worktree exists and `git -C "<worktree_path>" status --porcelain` is still non-empty, skip with `uncommitted changes in <worktree_path> — auto-commit was declined or failed` and continue with the next ticket. Never silently lose uncommitted work.

3. **Already merged upstream?** Run `git -C "$MAIN_ROOT" merge-base --is-ancestor <branch> <base-ref>`. If exit code is 0, the branch is already in the base — typical post-PR-merge state. Skip the merge step and go straight to step 5.

4. **Merge the branch into the base.** From the main checkout: `git -C "$MAIN_ROOT" merge --no-ff -m "Merge <branch> into <base>" <branch>`. `--no-ff` always produces a recognizable merge commit so the ticket's work can be reverted as a single unit later.
   - **On conflict**: run `git -C "$MAIN_ROOT" merge --abort` to clean up the half-merged state, record which files conflicted, skip cleanup for this ticket, and continue with the next.
   - **On other failure**: record the error, skip cleanup for this ticket, continue.

5. **Cleanup.**
   - `git -C "$MAIN_ROOT" worktree remove <worktree_path>` — removes the directory and unregisters the worktree.
   - `git -C "$MAIN_ROOT" branch -d <branch>` — safe delete. After our merge (or the upstream merge we detected) the branch is fully merged into HEAD, so `-d` will succeed.
   - If `worktree remove` fails because the worktree is missing on disk but registered, run `git -C "$MAIN_ROOT" worktree prune` and retry once.
   - If `branch -d` fails for any reason, do NOT fall back to `-D` — leave the branch and record the failure for the report. Forcing could lose unmerged work.

## Phase 5: Report

Print a summary the user can scan at a glance:

```
Merged 3 worktree(s) into dev:

  TICKET-007  auto-committed + merged + cleaned up
  TICKET-008  merged + cleaned up
  TICKET-009  already merged upstream — cleaned up
  TICKET-010  SKIPPED — uncommitted changes in .worktrees/010-fix-search (auto-commit declined or failed)
  TICKET-011  CONFLICT — files: src/foo.ts, src/bar.ts (worktree retained)

main checkout is now on: dev (<short-hash>)
```

Group entries by outcome (auto-committed-and-merged, merged, already-merged-and-cleaned, skipped, conflict, error) so the user immediately sees what needs follow-up. Tickets where Phase 3 step 6 synthesized a commit get the `auto-committed` prefix so the user can audit those commits afterward if they want.

Do not push to origin, and do not delete the remote branch. The only commits this skill ever creates are (a) the merge commits in Phase 4 and (b) the user-confirmed auto-commits in Phase 3 step 6. Push is a separate decision the user makes (often via `/commit-push-pr` or plain `git push`).

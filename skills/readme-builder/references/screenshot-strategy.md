# Screenshot Capture Strategy

This reference is loaded during Phase 4 of the readme-builder workflow when `screenshots_enabled = true` and the project type is browser-renderable (or a desktop project with Playwright helpers already installed).

The goal is to produce 3–5 representative PNGs that show what the application looks like, without burning time on flaky setup or fabricating coverage. **A clean failure is better than a misleading screenshot.**

## The capture loop

```
1. Discover dev-server command  ──┐
2. Discover port                  ├─► Phase 4a: setup
3. Start server (background)      │
4. Wait for port to respond       │
                                  │
5. Discover routes                ├─► Phase 4b: capture
6. For each route:                │
     navigate → screenshot → save │
                                  │
7. Stop server                    ├─► Phase 4c: cleanup
8. Verify files saved             │
```

If any step in 4a fails, abort the phase cleanly and continue to Phase 5 with a screenshots TODO. If 4b fails mid-capture, save whatever succeeded and TODO the rest.

## Dev-server discovery

Check `package.json#scripts` in this order:

1. `dev` — almost universal across modern JS frameworks.
2. `start` — common in CRA, some Express+UI setups; ambiguous (also a production-start script in many projects) — only use if `dev` is absent.
3. `serve` — Vue CLI legacy, some static-site setups.

For Python web apps (Django, Flask, FastAPI with a UI):

- Django: `python manage.py runserver` (if `manage.py` is at the project root).
- Flask: `flask run` (requires `FLASK_APP` env var); only use if `pyproject.toml#[tool.poetry.scripts]` or a `Makefile` target like `dev:` makes this concrete.
- FastAPI: `uvicorn <module>:app --reload` — only construct this if the codebase clearly has a `main.py` or `app.py` exposing `app`.

For Rails: `bin/rails server` (or `rails s`).

For Astro / SvelteKit / Nuxt without a `dev` script (rare), fall back to the framework default: `astro dev`, `vite dev`, `nuxt dev`.

If no dev-server command can be found, do not invent one. Abort the screenshots phase with the reason `no dev-server command detected`.

---

## Port discovery

Check in this order, taking the first match:

1. **Explicit script flag**: parse the dev script body. Common patterns:
   - `next dev -p 4000`
   - `vite --port 4000`
   - `astro dev --port 4000`
   - `npm run dev -- --port 4000`
2. **Framework config**:
   - `next.config.*` — usually 3000 (Next.js doesn't typically take a port in the config).
   - `vite.config.*` — `server.port`.
   - `astro.config.*` — `server.port` or `server: { port }`.
   - `svelte.config.*` — typically uses Vite under the hood; check `vite.config.*` if present.
   - `nuxt.config.*` — `devServer.port`.
3. **Environment variable**: if `.env.example` declares `PORT=...`, use that.
4. **Framework default**:

   | Framework | Default port |
   | --- | --- |
   | Next.js | 3000 |
   | Vite (any) | 5173 |
   | Astro | 4321 |
   | SvelteKit (vite-based) | 5173 |
   | Nuxt | 3000 |
   | CRA | 3000 |
   | Remix | 3000 |
   | Django | 8000 |
   | Rails | 3000 |
   | Flask | 5000 |
   | FastAPI / uvicorn | 8000 |

If the resolved port is in use (detected during the wait step), do not silently fall back to another port — that produces a screenshot of whatever happens to be on the other port. Abort the screenshots phase with the reason `port <N> already in use`.

---

## Waiting for the server

After starting the dev server with `run_in_background: true`, the port won't be ready immediately. Poll until it responds:

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 30); do
  if curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "http://localhost:${PORT}/" | grep -qE "^[2345]"; then
    break
  fi
  sleep 1
done
```

A 30-second budget is enough for almost all modern frameworks on a developer machine. If polling exhausts the budget, treat it as a failure and abort the phase.

Note: a `4xx` response is still "the server is up" — the homepage might 404 by design (e.g., the app's root path is `/app` or `/dashboard`). Accept any 2xx/3xx/4xx as "ready". Only 5xx and connection-refused mean "not ready yet".

---

## Route selection

Aim for 3–5 routes. Defaults:

1. **The root** (`/`) — always include, even if it 404s. The 404 page is itself part of the project's surface.
2. **Up to 4 additional routes** discovered as follows:

### Discovery heuristics

- **Navigation components**: look for files named `Nav*`, `Sidebar*`, `Header*`, `Menu*`, `MainNav*` in `components/`. Read each file and extract route paths from:
  - JSX `<Link href="...">`, `<NavLink to="...">`, `<a href="...">`.
  - Object literals like `{ label: "Dashboard", href: "/dashboard" }`.
- **Route definitions**:
  - Next.js App Router: pages at `app/<route>/page.tsx`.
  - Next.js Pages Router: `pages/<route>.tsx`.
  - Vite + React Router: search for `<Route path="...">`.
  - Astro: pages at `src/pages/<route>.astro`.
  - SvelteKit: `src/routes/<route>/+page.svelte`.

### Filtering

Skip routes that are likely to fail or be misleading:

- **Auth-walled routes** — those behind `/login`, `/auth`, `/account`, `/dashboard` if the project has visible auth setup (next-auth, clerk, lucia, supabase auth, etc.) AND the user has not provided test credentials. Skip these.
- **Dynamic routes with required params** — e.g., `app/posts/[id]/page.tsx`. Skip unless you can identify a specific param value that's known to render (e.g., a seed user ID hinted in `seed.ts` or fixtures). If unsure, skip.
- **API routes** — `app/api/*`, `pages/api/*`. Never include.
- **Catch-all 404 / error / not-found** — `app/not-found.tsx`, `app/error.tsx`. Skip; they're noise.

### Ranking

If more than 4 candidate routes survive filtering, pick the most user-visible:

1. Routes that appear in a top-level navigation component (highest priority).
2. Routes that match common product surfaces: `/`, `/about`, `/pricing`, `/features`, `/blog`, `/docs`, `/contact`, `/faq`, `/dashboard` (if not auth-walled).
3. Routes with shorter paths (less likely to be a sub-flow).

Cap at 4 additional routes. With the root, that's 5 total.

### When no routes can be discovered

For a single-page app with client-side routing and no obvious nav file, capture only `/` and move on. One screenshot is fine — better than two screenshots of the same page with a TODO note.

---

## Save location and naming

Pick the save directory in this order:

1. If `public/readme/` already exists → use it.
2. Else if `public/` exists AND project is a `web-app-browser` AND framework typically serves `public/` (Next.js, Astro, SvelteKit, Vite) → create and use `public/readme/`. Note in the README that screenshots live in `public/`.
3. Else → create and use `docs/images/`.

**Naming**: slugify the route, with the root path becoming `home`.

| Route | Filename |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | `home.png` |
| `/about` | `about.png` |
| `/blog/posts` | `blog-posts.png` |
| `/users/[id]` (rendered as `/users/42`) | `users-42.png` (use the actual rendered path) |

Always `.png`. Standardize on a single viewport width — `1280×800` is a reasonable default. The Playwright MCP screenshot tool takes whatever the browser shows; if you need a specific viewport, call `mcp__plugin_playwright_playwright__browser_resize` first.

---

## Cleanup and failure handling

### Cleanup (the happy path)

After all routes are captured:

1. Identify the background task ID for the dev server.
2. Kill it cleanly. If the dev server didn't capture its own port-cleanup, the user's next `npm run dev` will fail with "port in use" — this is hostile UX, so always stop cleanly.
3. Close the Playwright browser if it's still open: `mcp__plugin_playwright_playwright__browser_close`.

### Failure modes and responses

| Failure | Response |
| --- | --- |
| No dev-server command found | Skip Phase 4. README writes a TODO in the Screenshots section: `TODO: no dev-server command detected — add screenshots manually if applicable.` |
| Port already in use | Stop the (failed) background task. TODO: `Port N already in use — re-run after stopping the conflicting process.` |
| Server never reached 2xx/3xx/4xx within 30s | Stop the background task. TODO: `dev server didn't become ready within 30s — re-run after confirming the dev script works locally.` |
| Playwright MCP not configured | Skip Phase 4. TODO: `Playwright MCP not available — add screenshots manually.` |
| Playwright navigates but the page is blank / errors | Save what was captured of other routes; for the failing route specifically, TODO: `route <path> failed to render — see logs.` |
| One route 404s | That's fine — capture it anyway. A 404 is part of the project's surface. |

In every case, regardless of failure mode, **stop the dev server**. Leaving a runaway background process for the user to discover is unkind.

## Native-desktop notes

For Electron / Tauri:

- Only attempt screenshots if one of these is in `package.json` deps/devDeps:
  - `electron-playwright-helpers`
  - `playwright-electron`
  - `@playwright/test` AND a `playwright.config.*` that targets `electron`
  - For Tauri: `tauri-driver` plus a Selenium/Playwright bridge
- Otherwise, leave a TODO in the Screenshots section: `TODO: add desktop-app screenshots manually — auto-capture for desktop apps requires Playwright Electron helpers, which aren't installed here.`

For iOS / Android / React Native / Flutter — v1 does not attempt automatic capture. The README writes a TODO placeholder and continues. (Future versions could integrate with `xcrun simctl io ... screenshot` or `adb shell screencap`, but those add a lot of moving parts for relatively little gain on first-pass README generation.)
